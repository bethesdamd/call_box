Server and client side code related to the Call Box project.

Dependencies

Node.js
For now the most important thing is you need to install node.js and npm (node package manager).  Start here:  https://nodejs.org/en/download/

curl
Install curl for Windows:  https://curl.haxx.se/download.html

- Connect to AWS server: ssh ec2-user@52.91.247.184
- cd into ~/call_box directory which has the Node.js servers code
- run: node server1.js  --  server1.js is the server that listens for an HTTP message from the Particle vis a vis the Particle cloud publish() command.
It is presently configured to print a message to stdout when it receives the incoming HTTP message, this facilitates trouble-
shooting.  You do not have to have server2.js running for hardware testing unless you want to view the web page.
- run: node server2.js  --  server2.js is the server that will serve the web page for the UI that receives the warning message.  Also, this server
receives the message from server1 that it received.  This may seem odd or inefficient to have two servers, but it was the only
way I could figure out how to get this all to work.  Also it has the benefit of separating the server that receives the call box
message from the server that sits on the public internet, so e.g. a DOS attack on the web server would not affect the server
receiving the call box message.
- open a browser to http://52.91.247.184:8001/ (I think) to see the UI
